    - First Beta Release.

Version: 0.1.03
Date: 2024-02-11
  Major Features:
    - Works with IB's new function Build_badges, instead of adding properties to  prototypes.
    - Uses pcall() to log error message when Build_badges fails, and keep running.
    - Change the format of bigtable multiple times. Last one was one line per badgegroup per prototype.
    - Oops, not releasing this one either. There's an even better way to manage the data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.02
Date: 2024-01-06
  Major Features:
    - It compiles, but the badges aren't as expected. Some items don't have badges at all, even though they have 1-3-letter badges. Some have only the first letter.
    - Replaced bigtable with cvs-like file, complete with tips for editing in spreadsheet.
    - Changed how settings work for the badge groups.
  Plans:
    - Fix the position. All should be right-top, because SB puts other information in all other corners.
    - Fix the items that have badgegroup _broken. Hopefully it's just typos.
    - Do the recipes that don't take icons from main_product. Leave this until after icons from all items and fluids are working.
    - Activate two badge groups for science: color and Name.
    - Make the settings startup and by player, if possible.

Version: 0.1.01
Date: 2024-01-30
  Major Features:
    - newmod
    - icon-badges still objects to several SB items. I was able to fix some, but Galdoc will have to do the next one.
  Plans:
    - replace bigtable with cvs compatible, and tips for libreoffice
