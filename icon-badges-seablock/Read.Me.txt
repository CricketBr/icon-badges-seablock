This mod uses Icon Badges link to add text codes to many of the icons in the game. Check the settings for that mod as well as this one.

We're open to suggestions, but please check the FAQ and consider possible conflicts to avoid duplication of suggestions.

There are over 700 items and fluids with badges and the mod is limitted to "a 1 or 2 character string, consisting of lower- or upper-case letters or numbers (nothing else!). Valid examples: "AB", "aB", "Ab", "A", "b", "1A", "1".

If the only difference is colour, it gets a badge. Colour theory is fascinating and a bit confusing. If we missed something, let us know.

The full set of badges is here (possibly out of date)
