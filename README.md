Icon Badges Groups Nullius/SeaBlock is the data, and a few function calls, for [Icon Badges by Galdoc](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/icon-badges) and [Icon Badges Groups](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/icon-badges-groups) to work with Nullius/SeaBlock.

It has a (large!) csv-like file listing all the icons, and a badge for each badgegroup the icon is in. It also has data for the settings menu, so the player can choose which badgegroups to use, eg metals-group-english or metals-group-scientific.

This mod then calls functions in Icon Badges Groups to:
- create the game settings (English or scientific metals).
- convert the csv-like file to a lua table.
- call Icon Badges for each item, so Icon Badges can create the badge.

I'm open to suggestions for badges. If it's just a few changes, just send me your suggestions. If it's more, please contact me first, so we can find the best way to do it. Creating more badges and badgegroups (eg scientific terms for metals) is easy but tedious.

I can be reached through Discussion on the mod portal, and as Cricket in the SeaBlock and Nullius Discords.

More details on how it works are in the [Icon Badges Groups](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/icon-badges-groups) mod.

If you want to use it for another modpack, use the Nullius one for a template, since it shows how to use custom code for Nullius boxes.
