This mod adds properties to items, fluids and recipes for the Icon Badges mod. Check the settings for that mod as well as this one.

We are open to submissions for full or partial sets. A submission needs the name of the new set (what players will turn on or off), and a csv file with the following columns.

badgeset;group;subgroup;name;type;badge

eg

badgeset;group;subgroup;name;type;badge
main;bio-processing-alien;bio-processing-alien-large;alien-artifact;item;x1
main;bio-processing-alien;bio-processing-alien-pre;alien-pre-artifact-base;item;x1

Note that all fields mut begin with a letter, and quotation marks are not used.

Contact me through here, discussion on the mod portal, or the SeaBlock Discord.
